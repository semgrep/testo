# The goal is to convert LF to CRLF when checking out text files on Windows.
# This file specifies which file types should be treated as text or binary.
#
# Git config:
# - core.autocrlf should be unset
# - core.eol should be unset or set to 'native'
#
# See the official documentation for guidance.

# Default: auto-detect text files
* text=auto

# CRLFs and LFs in the diff tests are intentional and should not change.
# The *.diff files, however, should behave as ordinary text files subject
# to LF->CRLF conversion upon Git checkout.
