# Testo

> Party hard, test harder &mdash; DJ Testo

ðŸš§ _This project hasn't been released on Opam yet, lacks basic
documentation, and is still subject to frequent interface changes._

Testo is a test framework for OCaml that takes inspiration from its
predecessor [Alcotest](https://github.com/mirage/alcotest) and from
[pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/).
Testo adds the following features to Alcotest:

- comparing test outcome with expectation, allowing tests to be expected to
  fail;
- comparing captured output with expected output;
- approving new output;
- reviewing test status without re-running them;
- nested test suites;
- tags;
- more ways to select tests.

Like with Alcotest, a test executable is generated from a list of tests
written in OCaml. The function to interpret the command line
and run things is `Testo.interpret_argv`.
The core subcommands supported by a test executable are:

- `run`
- `status`
- `approve`

A test is fundamentally a name and test function of type
`unit -> unit`. A test is considered successful if the test function
returns normally and is considered failed if it raises an exception.
A test is created with `Testo.create` which takes a variety of options
in addition to the name and the test function.

Testo doesn't provide a library for writing assertions. Using the
[Alcotest](https://mirage.github.io/alcotest/alcotest/Alcotest/index.html)
module for this is recommended. For example,
checking that some test result `res` equals an expected value of `42`
is written as:
```ocaml
Alcotest.(check int) "equal" 42 res;
```
This raises an exception that is turned into a nice error message.
