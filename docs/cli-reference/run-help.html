<b class="BOLD">NAME</b>
       test-run - run the tests

<b class="BOLD">SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b class="BOLD">test run </b>[<b class=UND>OPTION</b>]…

<b class="BOLD">DESCRIPTION</b>
       Run all or only some of the tests. By default, the status of each test
       is reported as they are executed. Here's the legend for test statuses:

       • [PASS]: a successful test that was expected to succeed (good);
       • [FAIL]: a failing test that was expected to succeed (needs fixing);
       • [XFAIL]: a failing test that was expected to fail (tolerated failure);
       • [XPASS]: a successful test that was expected to fail (progress?).
       • [MISS]: a test that never ran;
       • [SKIP]: a test that is always skipped but kept around for some reason;
       • [xxxx*]: a new test for which there's no expected output yet.
         In this case, you should review the test output and run the 'approve'
         subcommand once you're satisfied with the output.


       To review the status of the tests without rerunning them, use the
       'status' subcommand.

<b class="BOLD">OPTIONS</b>
       <b class="BOLD">--autoclean</b>
           Remove test snapshots that don't match any test.

       <b class="BOLD">--debug</b>
           Log information that can be useful for debugging the Testo library.

       <b class="BOLD">-e </b><b class="BOLD UND"></b><b class=UND>KEY=VALUE</b>, <b class="BOLD">--env</b>=<b class=UND>KEY=VALUE</b>
           Pass  a key/value pair to the function that creates the test suite.
           KEY   must   be   an   alphanumeric   identifier   of   the    form
           [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z_0-9]*. VALUE can be any string. This mechanism for
           passing  arbitrary runtime settings to the test suite is offered as
           a safer alternative to  environment  variables.  Multiple  -e/--env
           options  are  supported  in  the  same  command,  each defining one
           key/value pair.

       <b class="BOLD">--expert</b>
           Assume the user is familiar with Testo and don't show non-essential
           messages or tips targeted at new users.

       <b class="BOLD">-j </b><b class="BOLD UND"></b><b class=UND>NUM</b>, <b class="BOLD">--jobs</b>=<b class=UND>NUM</b>
           Specify the number of jobs to run in  parallel.  By  default,  this
           value  is  set  to the number of CPUs detected on the machine. Both
           '-j0' and '-j1' ensure sequential, non-overlapping execution of the
           tests. Unlike '-j1',  '-j0'  will  not  create  a  separate  worker
           process  to  run  the  tests. The default can be changed by passing
           '~default_workers' to the  OCaml  function  'Testo.interpret_argv'.
           NOTE: Parallel executation of tests is not stable on Windows.

       <b class="BOLD">--lazy</b>
           Run only the tests that were not previously successful.

       <b class="BOLD">--max-inline-log-bytes</b>=<b class=UND>LIMIT</b> (absent=<b class="BOLD">1000000</b>)
           When  displaying  logs (unchecked stdout or stderr output), show at
           most that many bytes for each test. The default  limit  is  1000000
           bytes. To remove the default limit, specify 'unlimited'.

       <b class="BOLD">-s </b><b class="BOLD UND"></b><b class=UND>SUBSTRING</b>, <b class="BOLD">--filter-substring</b>=<b class=UND>SUBSTRING</b>
           Select  tests  whose  description contains <b class=UND>SUBSTRING</b>. Multiple '-s'
           search queries can be specified in which  case  only  one  of  them
           needs to match.

       <b class="BOLD">--slice</b>=<b class=UND>NUM/NUM_SLICES</b>
           Divide  the  test  suite into NUM_SLICES and work on slice NUM only
           (1-based). For example, '1/4' is the first of four slices and '4/4'
           is the last one. If multiple '--slice' options are specified,  they
           are  applied sequentially from left to right. If the original suite
           defines 23 tests,  '--slice  2/4'  selects  tests  [7,8,9,10,11,12]
           (1-based).  If  additionally '--slice 1/3' is specified after it on
           the same command line, the remaining  tests  will  be  [7,8].  This
           filter  is  meant  for  running  tests in parallel, possibly across
           multiple hosts. It is applied after any  other  filters  to  as  to
           divide the work more evenly.

       <b class="BOLD">--strict</b>
           Treat  broken  tests  as  ordinary tests. This disables the default
           behavior of ignoring failing tests that were marked  as  broken  by
           the  programmer  when  determining  the overall success of the test
           run.

       <b class="BOLD">-t </b><b class="BOLD UND"></b><b class=UND>TAG</b>, <b class="BOLD">--filter-tag</b>=<b class=UND>TAG</b>
           Select tests tagged with <b class=UND>TAG</b>. Filtering by tag  is  generally  more
           robust  than  selecting  tests by text contained in their name with
           '-s'.

       <b class="BOLD">--test-list-checksum</b>=<b class=UND>STR</b>
           Internal use only. This is a checksum used to check that  the  list
           of  tests  generated  in  a worker is the same as the list of tests
           generated by the master.

       <b class="BOLD">-v</b>, <b class="BOLD">--verbose</b>
           Print more details than by default. Currently, this  is  equivalent
           to  '--show-output'  but it may be extended in the future to bundle
           up more options.

       <b class="BOLD">-w</b>, <b class="BOLD">--show-output</b>
           Show the output of all tests rather than only showing the output of
           the failed tests. This excludes  the  output  (stdout,  stderr,  or
           both)  that  may  be  captured  explicitly  to  be compared against
           expectations.

       <b class="BOLD">--worker</b>
           Internal option used to launch a parallel worker.

<b class="BOLD">COMMON OPTIONS</b>
       <b class="BOLD">--help</b>[=<b class=UND>FMT</b>] (default=<b class="BOLD">auto</b>)
           Show this help in format <b class=UND>FMT</b>. The value <b class=UND>FMT</b> must be  one  of  <b class="BOLD">auto</b>,
           <b class="BOLD">pager</b>,  <b class="BOLD">groff  </b>or  <b class="BOLD">plain</b>.  With  <b class="BOLD">auto</b>, the format is <b class="BOLD">pager </b>or <b class="BOLD">plain</b>
           whenever the <b class="BOLD">TERM </b>env var is <b class="BOLD">dumb </b>or undefined.

<b class="BOLD">EXIT STATUS</b>
       <b class="BOLD">test run </b>exits with:

       0   on success.

       123 on indiscriminate errors reported on standard error.

       124 on command line parsing errors.

       125 on unexpected internal errors (bugs).
