{0 Testo_lwt}

This is the {!Testo_lwt} module provided by the [testo-lwt] library and
Opam package. It adds support to [Testo] for test functions that return
Lwt promises of type [unit Lwt.t] instead of returning [unit].
{!Testo_lwt}'s interface is otherwise identical to [Testo].

Using {!Testo_lwt} is recommended only if you use Lwt but your environment
doesn't support running [Lwt_run.main] to turn a promise into a synchronous
computation.
