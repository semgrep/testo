{0 Testo_lwt}

This the {!Testo_lwt} module provided by the [testo-lwt] library and
Opam package. It adds support to {!Testo} for test functions that are Lwt
promises of type [unit -> unit Lwt.t].

It is recommended only if you use Lwt but your environment doesn't support
running [Lwt_run.main] to turn a promise into a synchronous computation.
