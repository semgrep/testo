(* Master side

   This code runs in the master process which is a client to the workers.
   The child process will initialize from argv, collecting the list
   of tests again. If the list of tests is obtained by scanning the
   filesystem for test cases, then this discovery will take place again
   in each new worker.

   Here, all we need to know about tests is their unique identifier
   provided by 'test_test_id'.
